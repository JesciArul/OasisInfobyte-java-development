<h1 align="center">🚀 Oasis Infobyte – Java Development Internship Projects</h1>
<h3 align="center">Hands-on console applications built to master Core Java & OOP concepts</h3>

<br>

## 🌟 About The Internship

This repository contains **five console-based Java applications** developed during my **Java Development Internship at Oasis Infobyte** (February 2026).

These projects helped me practice:

- Core Java syntax and logic
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- ArrayLists and data management
- Input validation and exception handling
- Menu-driven interactive console programs
- Transaction & workflow simulation (ATM, Library, Exam, Reservations)

Perfect for:

- Java beginners and intermediate learners  
- Students preparing for Java internships  
- Anyone building a strong foundation before GUI, JDBC, or Spring Boot
